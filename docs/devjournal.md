### Entry 10: Pre-Build Q&A
**User Asked**: "Before we start building, what questions do you have for me?"

**Questions Asked**:
1. Map vs Feed - which is primary?
2. Which specific sources first?
3. Local dev or deploy immediately?
4. Database needed for MVP?
5. Confidence scores - how should they work?
6. "Share via text" - what does this mean?
7. Git repo?
8. Bluesky account?
9. Design mockups first?

**User Answered**:
1. **Feed-first** with simple watchpoint graphic/filter showing activity indicators
2. **All constants**, Middle East/Iran priority
3. **Local dev**, use Chrome extension or Playwright for testing
4. **No DB** - just fetch and display
5. **Static from sources.md**, develop ranking system later
6. **KISS** - whatever is easy (copy to clipboard or native SMS)
7. **Yes, full git authority** including commits
8. **Yes**: trevthewebdev.bsky.social
9. **Straight to code**, iterate
