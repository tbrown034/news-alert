# Iran War Watch - Source Intelligence

**Created:** 2026-02-25
**Context:** Multiple indicators suggest US military action against Iran within days to weeks. This folder tracks source discovery, evaluation, and additions specifically for this escalation.

## Situation
- US-Iran tensions at highest point since 2020 Soleimani strike
- Nuclear program acceleration / IRGC posturing
- Need maximum coverage from OSINT, reporters, analysts, and official channels

## File Structure
```

```

## Priority Coverage Gaps
1. **Iran nuclear program analysts** - arms control, nonproliferation experts
2. **US CENTCOM / Pentagon reporters** - defense beat journalists
3. **Gulf state analysts** - Saudi/UAE/Bahrain positioning
4. **Iranian diaspora OSINT** - Farsi-to-English translators, protest trackers
5. **Shipping/maritime trackers** - Strait of Hormuz, oil tanker movements
6. **Aviation/military trackers** - flight tracking, force positioning
7. **Congressional/policy voices** - Senate Foreign Relations, war powers
8. **European diplomatic sources** - JCPOA-adjacent, EU foreign policy

## Quality Bar
- Must post in English
- Must be active (posted in last 14 days given urgency)
- Substantive content (analysis, breaking news, sourced reporting)
- Confidence >= 70 for analysts, >= 80 for official/news-org
